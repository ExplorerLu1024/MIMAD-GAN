## MIM-GAN-based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series Data



## Quickstart

- Python3

- Please download the SWaT and WADI datasets in the data folder before run RGAN.py and AD.py

- To train the model:
  
  """ python RGAN.py --settings_file swat """

- To do anomaly detection:

  """ python AD.py --settings_file swat_test"""

## Data

We apply our method on the SWaT and WADI datasets in the paper, however, we didn't upload the data in this repository. Please refer to(https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/testbeds/secure-water-treatment-swat/ï¼Œ https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/) and send request to iTrust is you want to try the data.
